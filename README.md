## About me

### What are some honest, unfiltered things about you?
* I believe that the best way to motivate people at work and create a sense of pride and quality in a company is to optimize for happiness — that means making sure people have great work-life balance, are paid fairly and generously, and are supported when they're struggling.
* I don't believe in glorifying burnout or the "rockstar" mentality of individual superheroes that carry a team — for me, work is only worthwhile when it's collaboration between a group of people who respect, teach and learn from each other.
* I'm gay and come from a poor background. I think seeing the world from some unusual perspectives in my life has made me more tolerant of differences of opinion but also less willing to accept things I see as unjust.

### What drives you nuts?
* *Tell us about your pet peeves. These are things that put you in a bad mood.*
* I believe async culture is very important, especially at GitHub, and unnecessary meetings get on my nerves because they're so inefficient and often tiring.
* I dislike jargon and unnecessary acronyms because I feel they're alienating to those new to a field or team and slow us down with misunderstandings. 
* I love GitHub as a product and it drives me nuts when we use other products for purposes where GitHub would work perfectly. Understanding and using GitHub as much as possible is really important to understanding its users so we can uphold its high quality. 

### What are your quirks?
* I'm a verbal processor and find that I reach decisions and consolidate my opinions much quicker through synchronous discussion with others than on my own.
* I'm good at speaking up, filling silences, and making people feel welcome, though I'm an introvert and prefer pairing or working in a small group to large conference calls.
* When dealing with conflict, reacting quickly with a Slack DM to correct any misunderstandings and check in with how people are feeling, then jumping on a call as soon as possible to talk things through works best for me.
		
### What are some things that people might misunderstand about you that you should clarify?
* *Think of some labels people may apply to you. Tell us why those are wrong.*
* I've been at GitHub since 2017 and at times I might've been labeled as an old-school curmudgeon because I don't like jargon and I prefer to use GitHub for GitHub when it's the best tool for the job. But these are for the reasons above, not just because it's how we've worked in the past. 
* I don't know if anyone thinks of me this way, but I might be considered sensitive because I have sometimes cried in conversations at work. I think that crying at work is stigmatised unfairly and shouldn't be surprising or undesirable at a workplace that is open and accepting, and where people care a lot their work and team.

## About my colleagues

### What qualities do you particularly value in your colleagues?
* *Tell us what your ideal colleague would look like. These are the people you normally seek out at work.* 
* I really value sensitive, thoughtful, empathetic colleagues who like to reach decisions dialectically and seek information from those best positioned to provide it rather than those with the most power or status.  
* I love honesty, transparency and plainness of language and gravitate towards people who can be clear and easily understood without reaching for acronyms or pie charts when they're not necessary.
* I love people who are kind and caring about their colleagues and understand that it's important to optimise for a sustainable, happy and healthy work culture.

### What do you wish colleagues didn’t do?
* *Think of the people you avoid at work. What are their characteristics?*
* I dislike formality and stuffiness of language and process - those who use a lot of acronyms or make overly wordy presentations out of things that would make a better Issue or async Slack conversation.
* I avoid people who wield words about diversity and inclusion in tokenistic or exploitative ways but aren't willing to take brave steps and have difficult conversations when they're necessary to further those causes.
	
### How can people earn an extra gold star with you?
* Use great Slack emojis that I've never seen before, do something unusually kind for a colleague, communicate with clarity and sincerity to make it effortless for everyone around you to feel up-to-date.

## About my interactions

### How do you coach people to do their best work and develop their talents?
* I think I help others most by being patient, compassionate, encouraging and supportive. I like to listen to people about their intentions and goals, then do what I can to help them get there. Sometimes sharing my experience of GitHub as a product or as a company can come in handy too.
	
### What’s the best way to communicate with you?
* *If you hate emails, tell us. If you prefer a quick zoom over a 15 min write up, tell us.*
* I like to communicate using the method that best suits the situation. For brainstorming, puzzling things out, venting, or socialising, I like to use a Zoom conversation. For details, longer conversations, ones among a larger group or where information will need to be referred back to, I like issues, pull requests or Slack discussions. Emails are best for—just kidding, emails aren't useful for anything.
	
### What’s the best way to convince you to do something?
* I don't typically take much convincing to do things, but if it's something controversial then invite me to a Zoom, explain why it's the best course of action, answer my questions, and show me that you understand the arguments against it if there are any.
	 
### How do you like to give feedback?
* I like to give positive feedback on Slack and in issues where I can highlight someone's good work and thank them for it, but I'm also a fan having earnest conversations to give feedback, good or bad, on Zoom. 

### How do you like to get feedback?
* I don't think I'm too fussy about how I receive good feedback — I do like to get sparkles and shoutouts on Slack or in written mediums. Sometimes I like to scrapbook good feedback I've gotten to look back over when I'm feeling down. I think I prefer to receive bad feedback on Zoom so I can talk about how to improve.
